    <p align="justify">I obtained a Ph.D. in information management from the National Sun Yat-sen University, where I was advised by Dr. San-Yih Hwang and received my degree in July 2021. During my time as a visiting student in the College of Computing & Informatics at Drexel University from February 2020 to January 2021, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in applying NLP to healthcare data that I continue to build on in my current postdoctoral research role.
