<h1>About</h1>
<div class="about-paragraph">
    <p align="justify">I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the Health Informatics Research Lab at Drexel University College of Computing & Informatics. My research interests primarily focus on natural language processing (NLP) and health informatics. One of my key research areas is resource-efficient cross-lingual text analysis, specifically cross-lingual topic modeling, aiming to analyze common topics from multilingual corpora without the need for human intervention. I am also investigating the use of data-driven approaches and generative AI (GenAI) to make a meaningful impact on healthcare and advance our understanding of how data can be used to improve people's lives.

    <p align="justify">I earned my Ph.D. in information management from the National Sun Yat-sen University, where I was advised by Dr. San-Yih Hwang and received my degree in July 2021. During my time as a visiting student in the College of Computing & Informatics at Drexel University from February 2020 to January 2021, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in applying NLP to healthcare data that I continue to build on in my current postdoctoral research role (February 2023 - Present), mentored by Dr. Christopher Yang.
